# Cristian Vel√°squez  - Front-end Javascript Challenge for JobSity


This project was generated with Angular CLI 11.2.14.

I've used these libraries:
- moment for date-time management
- ng-bootstrap for UI (Bootstrap 4.5)
- angular2-ladda & ladda for waiting signal
- lodash sorting for sort reminders
- @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome for icons
- ngx-color-picker for color palette 
- ngx-toastr for toast notifications

I've made a litle backend in express and hosted it in heroku with Mongo database in Atlas
